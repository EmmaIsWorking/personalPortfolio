					. I am 28 years old and
					<b> I like to build pages with a great user experience.</b>

        <p>
					Since I was a child, I was excited by the idea of being able to build
					things that help people solve their problems

					</span>
					. I started learning to give technical support to people and some
					companies, although little about the graph and although it is
					incredible, I always miss something and found it in the creation of
					web pages.
				</p>
				
        <p>
					I keep learning every day with the dream of being able to develop
					incredible applications that help millions of people
